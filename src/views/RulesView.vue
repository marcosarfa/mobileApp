                        Through these communities, you can post, comment, vote, discuss, learn, debate, support, and
                        connect with
                        people who share your interests, and we encourage you to find—or even create—your home.

                        Likewise, everyone on Reddit should have an expectation of privacy and
                        safety, so
                        please respect the privacy and safety of others.


                        Reddit and its communities are only what we make of them together, and can only exist if we
                        operate by a
                        shared set of rules. We ask that you abide by not just the letter of these rules, but the spirit
                        as well.

                                <strong>Rule 1.</strong> Remember the human. This is a place for creating community and
                                belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a
                                right to use it free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and
                                users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will
                                be banned.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Rule 2.</strong> Abide by community rules. Post authentic content into
                                communities where you have a personal interest, and do not cheat or engage in content
                                manipulation (including spamming, vote manipulation, ban evasion, or subscriber fraud)
                                or otherwise interfere with or disrupt our community.

                                <strong>Rule 3.</strong> Respect the privacy of others. Instigating harassment, for
                                example by revealing someone’s personal or confidential information, is not allowed.
                                Never post or threaten to post intimate or sexually-explicit media of nobody.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Rule 4.</strong> Do not post or encourage the posting of sexual or suggestive
                                content.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Rule 5.</strong> You don’t have to use your real name to use H&F-Tec, but don’t
                                impersonate an individual or an entity in a misleading or deceptive manner.
