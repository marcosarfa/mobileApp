                        <strong>My account was temporarily suspended</strong>Accounts may be temporarily suspended for
                        violating the content policy. At the time of suspension, you will receive a private message
                        informing you of the reason and duration of the suspension.

                        While suspended, you will be able to log into your account, but unable to participate on the
                        site. Other users
                        will not be able to see that your account is suspended.

                        <strong>My account was permanently suspended</strong>Accounts may be permanently suspended for
                        violating the content policy or if they are compromised and unable to be securely recovered. At
                        the time of suspension, you will receive a private message informing you of the reason.

                        You will be able to log into your account, but unable to participate on the site through
                        posting, commenting, voting, or moderating. Other users who look at your profile page will see only a message
